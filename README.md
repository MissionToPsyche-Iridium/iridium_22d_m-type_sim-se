## Description of Project
The aim of this project is to create a web based tool that allows users to learn and 
experiment with simulations for sampling a metal asteroid in the NASA Psyche mission. 
This product aims to help users understand the possible solutions for sampling a 
metal-based (M-type) asteroid by allowing them to interact with a virtual environment. 
The system will integrate real-world data that contains examples of those samples. 
NASAâ€™s Psyche mission aims to create an engaging and accessible platform for the 
scientific community and for the public to simulate M-type asteroid sampling and 
analysis without the need to download software.  NASA Psyche wants to address the lack 
of easily accessible tools that allow for public and more professional communities to 
interact with and simulate sampling scenarios. The key challenge here is to develop a 
browser based tool that creates an intuitive application for public consumption, 
allowing users to visualize, learn and interact with asteroid sampling in a meaningful 
way. The project will be built using web based frameworks, such as VUE and Unity, and 
hosted on Firebase for easy access.
