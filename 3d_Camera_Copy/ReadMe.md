# ***3D Orbital Camera***  
This Unity script allows users to create a 3D orbital camera that rotates around a target object using the WASD keys. The camera maintains a fixed distance from the target while allowing smooth rotation along both horizontal (left-right) and vertical (up-down) axes.

## **Features**  
1. Horizontal Rotation (A/D keys): Rotate the camera left and right around the target.  

2. Vertical Rotation (W/S keys): Rotate the camera up and down around the target.  

3. Fixed Distance: The camera maintains a fixed distance from the target, ensuring smooth orbiting behavior. 

4. Auto LookAt: The camera always looks at the target during movement.
